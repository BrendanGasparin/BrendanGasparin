### Cybersecurity Projects

[PHP Login System](https://github.com/brendangasparin/php-login-system/): A login system written in PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with a SQL database. It transmits securely hashed passwords from the browser to be stored on the server to protect authentication credentials in case of database breaches. It uses PHP PDO as a database access layer with placeholders to prevent SQL injection. The project is based on a YouTube video by Dani Krossing, but with extra features (such as more feedback for users entering invalid input). It comes with an installation guide, and a .sql file to initialize the datbase.  
[JavaScript Cryptography](https://brendangasparin.github.io/js-cryptography/): Written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this is my website for practicing cryptography. Currently it has Caesar (ROT) and substitution cipher encrypters abd decrypters.  
[Strong Password Generator in C](https://github.com/brendangasparin/c-password-generator): A strong password generator written in the C programming language. This is a console program that you must git clone and compile in order to use. It generates strong random passwords of any length the user chooses, from 8 to 65,535 characters. Every password is guaranteed to contain an uppercase character, a lowercase character, a digit, and a special character.  
[Strong Password Generator in JavaScript](https://brendangasparin.github.io/js-password-generator): This website is a strong password generator written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It does the same things as the C one but allows users to generate passwords from a live web interface. It has a button to copy the generated password to your device's clipboard that I think is pretty neat.  
[Google Home Page Mockup](https://brendangasparin.github.io/google-homepage/): A fake Google homepage written in HTML and CSS for The Odin Project. It's not interactive and does not do anything malicious, but it serves as an example of how to create a phishing site by copying the layout and content of a legitimate site. It's not responsive on mobile because that was not part of the assignment requirements.  
[Cybersecurity Resources](https://github.com/BrendanGasparin/list-cybersecurity-resources): A curated list of resources with content focused on cybersecurity.  
[Hacking and Penetration Testing Resources](https://github.com/BrendanGasparin/list-hacking-resources): A curated list of resources with content focused on hacking and penetration testing.

[Etch-a-Sketch web app](https://brendangasparin.github.io/etch-a-sketch/): An Etch-a-Sketch web app written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, also for The Odin Project curriculum.  
[Buddy's Homepage](https://brendangasparin.github.io/buddy/): My dog wrote his own homepage. I had to help with the CSS because dogs have dichromatic vision.  
[CSS art of the Pokemon Gastly](https://brendangasparin.github.io/css-gastly/): CSS animation written in HTML and CSS.  
[C Tutorial](https://brendangasparin.github.io/c-tutorial/): A tutorial written in HTML and CSS that aims to teach the basics of the C programming language to new programmers.  
[HTML Tutorial](https://brendangasparin.github.io/html-tutorial/): A HTML tutorial written in HTML (HTMLception!) and CSS. It aims to take the user from zero knowledge on web design to the completion of a first simple web page.  

### Games

[Rock Paper Scissors](https://brendangasparin.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/): Rock, Paper, Scissors written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
[Berzerk clone](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/984200658/): A clone of 1980 video game Berzerk, made with MIT's Scratch platform and my own art assets.  
[Griffin Flight Simulator](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/679806917/): A side-scrolling game I made using Scratch.

## I'm currently working on:
[100 Days of Code](https://github.com/BrendanGasparin/100-days-of-code/blob/main/log.md): A challenge in which you must code for at least one hour every day, tweet your progress and log it on Github, and encourage at least two other participants a day who are using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag on Twitter/X.  
[CS50x](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science): I am taking Hardvard's CS50x course online, as it is an excellent way to brush up on C, Python, SQL, and web development languages, as well as general data structures and algorithms.  
[Google Cybersecurity Professional certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-cybersecurity): I am training to become a cybersecurity professional.  
[PHP Social Network](https://github.com/BrendanGasparin/php-social-network): A free and open source social network web application written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, PHP, and SQL.  
[Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/BrendanGasparin/c-tic-tac-toe): I'm writing a Tic-Tac-Toe game in the C language. Two player games are implemented, but I want to create an AI player with various difficulty levels.

I have a Bachelor's Degree in Computing from the University of Tasmania and am continuing self-education through [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/), [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org/), [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/), YouTube, and the Google Cybersecurity certificate program on Coursera. I also work on personal projects, which are listed below.
