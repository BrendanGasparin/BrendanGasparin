## Portfolio

### Cybersecurity Projects

[Strong Password Generator in C](https://github.com/brendangasparin/c-password-generator): A strong password generator written in the C programming language. This is a console program that you must git clone and compile in order to use. Challenges included taking user input for the password length without allowing them to cause an input buffer overfllow.  
[Strong Password Generator in JavaScript](https://brendangasparin.github.io/js-password-generator): A strong password generator written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This allows users to generate passwords from a live web interface. After I made the app I realised phone users couldn't easily cut and paste the generated passwords, so a challenge I faced was implementing a button that allows users to copy the generated password to their clipboard for reuse.  
[ROT-13 Converter](https://brendangasparin.github.io/js-rot13/): Encrypt plaintext using the ROT-13 cipher. Written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Games

## I'm currently working on:

[CS50x](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science): I am taking Hardvard's CS50 course online, as it is an excellent way to brush up on C, Python, SQL, and web development languages, as well as general data structures and algorithms.

## Biography

I am a cybersecurity enthusiast, independent developer, writer, and content creator. I live in Tasmania, Australia. I strongly believe in the power of technology to affect positive change in the world and people's lives.

I'm running a small [web development startup business](https://cyborgplatypus.com.au/) and writing articles for my [tech blog](https://brendangasparin.com.au/blog/) and [free tech newsletter](https://brendangasparin.com.au/subscribe/). I also write code for at least an hour a day, and am undertaking the Google Cybersecurity Professional certification.

Education is vital. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Computing from the University of Tasmania and am self-learning through [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org/), [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/), and other platforms.

I live with my best friend [Buddy the Beagador](https://brendangasparin.github.io/buddy/). He is an accomplished web coder who enjoys chewing, sniffing things, and bench-surfing for food.

I can be found at the following [online hangouts](https://linktr.ee/brendangasparin).
